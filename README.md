# HYPY - HYper-v in PYthon
Multiplataform Hyper-V Manager using Python and FreeRDP

## How HYPY works?
Hypy uses winrm to comunicate with hyper-v server shell and sends powershell commands to interact with the virtual machines. Using Powershell, HYPY can get Name, ID and state of virtual machines. Therefore, HYPY call freeRDP with vm-id and credentials, using settings in `.conf` file to connect the vm.

## Pre-requisites
### WinRM
Hypy uses winrm to communicate with the hyper-v host, so it must be enabled and accepting connections.
https://github.com/diyan/pywinrm has a session explaining how to Enable WinRM on the remote host.

### FreeRDP
FreeRDP binary must be in path (windows, linux and mac). Make sure FreeRDP is working before using hypy or it will not open the session to the virtual machine.

#### Linux: Your package manager should have freerdp 1.1.* avaiable or compile from source.
#### Mac: When using homebrew, make share to include --HEAD option to get the lastest version (1.1.*) with HyperV support or use macports. Either way you will need XCode installed.

Look into https://github.com/FreeRDP/FreeRDP for more instructions.


## Configuration
To configure Hypy, change the file 'hypy.conf'
```ini
[credentials]
host = <server name in domain>
domain = <domain name>
user = <user name in server> (base64 format)
pass = <password> (base64 format)

[options]
cache_file = <name of cache file>
sync_interval = <interval in hours to make new cache file>
```
You must have write permissions to the path pointed by cache_file

## usage
If you don't know how to use hypy, you can use `hypy.py --help`
```
hypy.py --help
  Usage: hypy.py [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  Multiplataform Hyper-V Manager using Python and FreeRDP

Options:
  --help  Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  connect  Connect to virtual machine identified by...
  create   Create a new snapshot with vm's current state
  delete   Delete a machine's snapshot by name
  list     List virtual machines and its indexes
  pause    Pause virtual machine identified by index
  restore  Restore virtual machine snapshot
  resume   Resume (paused) virtual machine identified by...
  snaps    List virtual machine snapshots
  start    Start virtual machine identified by index
  stop     Stop virtual machine identified by index
```
If you need help on any subcommand, run `hypy.py COMMAND --help`

### list
```
hypy.py list --help
Usage: hypy.py list [OPTIONS]

  List virtual machines and its indexes

Options:
  -s, --sync  Syncronize with server updating local cache
  --help      Show this message and exit.
```
Hypy will create a cache with indexes for each machine. These indexes are used by other hypy commands to interact with the virtual machines.
If your cache is older than the duration specified in sync_interval, a new cache will be created, so the machine's states will be updated.
To force an cache update use the sync parameter.

A machine listing would look like this:
```
-- Hyper-V Virtual Machine Listing --
Index State   Name                           Uptime
[  0] saved   MACHINE 001                    0:00:00
