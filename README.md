# HYPY - HYper-v in PYthon

[![Build status](https://gitlab.com/gabriel.avanzi/hypy/badges/master/pipeline.svg)](https://gitlab.com/gabriel.avanzi/hypy/pipelines)

Multiplatform Hyper-V Manager using Python and FreeRDP

## How hypy works?
Hypy uses winrm or ssh to comunicate with hyper-v server shell and sends powershell commands to interact with the virtual machines. To access the virtual machines, hypy uses freeRDP.

## Hyper-V Server configuration
### Clients connecting via WinRM
Hypy uses winrm to communicate with the hyper-v host, so it must be enabled and accepting connections.
https://github.com/diyan/pywinrm has a session explaining how to enable WinRM on the server/remote host.

### Clients connecting via SSH
As an alternative to winrm, you can setup a SSH server on the hyper-v server. Using the protocol parameter in command line or setting ssh in the protocol option.

## Client configuration
### FreeRDP
FreeRDP binary must be in path (windows, linux and mac). Make sure FreeRDP is working before using hypy or it will not open the session to the virtual machine.

#### Linux: Your package manager should have freerdp 1.1 or higher avaiable.
Example in Ubuntu: `sudo apt install freerdp2-x11`

#### Mac: When using homebrew, make share to include --HEAD option to get the latest version (1.1 or higher) with HyperV support or use macports. Either way you will need XCode installed.
`brew install freerdp --HEAD`

If you need to compile freerdp, look into https://github.com/FreeRDP/FreeRDP for instructions.

## Install instructions
Hypy can be installed with pip.
Using pypi package:
```
pip3 install hypy3
```
Using github package:
```
pip3 install git+https://github.com/avanzzzi/hypy.git
```

## Configuration
To configure Hypy, create the file '~/.hypy.conf'. You can use hypy.conf.example that comes with the package to get a starting point or use the contents below.
These options can be overriden in the command line if needed. Also, you can generate this file using `hypy credentials create`
```ini
[credentials]
host = <server name in domain>
domain = <domain name>
user = <username in server>
pass = <password>

[options]
protocol = <ssh or winrm>
ssh_port = 22
sync_interval = <interval in hours to make new cache file>
```
## usage
```
> hypy --help
